Use this rule each time you are going to implement new code into the project, for example: workflows, tables, components, API, functionalities, etc.

1. Go the ./README.md file and understand how the project works
2. Then according to the type of functionality review the ./README_DEV_FRONT.md, ./README_DEV_BACK.md or both to now more about the programming guidelines.
3. Implement the functionality in steps that could be testeable and modularized
4. Refresh the README.md, ./README_FRONT.md and ./README_BACK.md with the new feature implemented
